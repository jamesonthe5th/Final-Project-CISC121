Algorithm selected:
I chose to use merge sort for my algorithm of choice because first it is quite good at dealing with larger input sizes as it has a time complexity of O(nlogn).
- It also demonstrates a divide and conquer algorithm which I understand more than other algorithms. 
- It is also easy to test edge cases.
